# CAD Exchanger Web Toolkit

The CAD Exchanger Web Toolkit is a JavaScript library to visualize, explore and analyze 3D CAD models. Web Toolkit can be used to develop web applications running publicly or on premise (i.e. inside a corporate network).

The CAD Exchanger Web Toolkit is used as an underlying engine of [CAD Exchanger Online Viewer](https://viewer.cadexchanger.com/).
